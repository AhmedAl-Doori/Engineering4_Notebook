# Engineering 4 Notebook
This is an **overview** of the programs in this repository. All the assignmetns are operated on [PIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), small portable computers that understand python as a main language. There's HTML for working the Flask application, but it's only used for templates.

**\*\* The assignments are organized based on the programs folder in the repository. Open the links to read more about them in the WIKI!**
